# AI sudoku solver using Backtracking algorithm
 A sudoku puzzle consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains an integer 1-9.
 The 9x9 grid is divided into 9x9 subgrids
The solution to the puzzle must satisfy the following conditions
    *>Each row contains digits 1-9 without repetition*
    *>Each column contains digits 1-9 without repetition*
    *>Each subgrid contains digits 1-9 without repetition*
The puzzle is given with some of the cells empty.
This python project aims to create an AI algorithm to solve sudoku.
